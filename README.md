# ShoreBird Demo

A Flutter Demo project, to showcase the basic workings of ShoreBird.

## Steps (*please complete basic shorebird setup on the laptop first.*)

1. Clear the releases at https://console.shorebird.dev/apps/9c5d29f8-77ac-4de6-bae8-cdc1a0eca9c4 (*as of now only mayank.joshi@spicemoney can access it, in free tier. If we buy a pais plan then we can add team other members to the same project.*)

2. Checkout the "shorebird_setup" branch. "Main" brach does not have shorebird configured.
3. Then run "shorebird release android" to create a release.
4. Then run "shorebird preview". 
5. Then change anyColor. Text color or background color or anything. 
6. Then run "shorebird patch android". Once the command is run successfully. Kill the app in the emulator.
7. Then again run the app from app drawer. This time the new updates will be donwloaded and the next time the app restarts the changes will be visible.
8. Kill the app and restart. The changes will be visible, without running the application.
9. Change to "UI_update" branch and again run "shorebird patch android". Once the command is run just kill the app and restart. Seond time the addition of ui will be reflected.
